the function of "if __name__ == '__main__':"

A Python file is usually used in two ways:
first,it can be executed directly as a script,
and second,it can be invoked (module reuse) by importing it into another Python script.
So if __name__ == '__main__': controls the process of executing code in both cases,
in if __name__ == '__main__'ï¼šThe following code is executed only in the first case
(that is, the file is executed directly as a script),
and imports into other scripts are not executed.


in other words
Determine whether the module is run directly or imported

When a module is run directly, __name__ equals __main__,
and when it is imported as a normal module, __name__ is the name of the module itself.
